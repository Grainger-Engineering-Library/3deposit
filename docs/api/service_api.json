// this template defines the payload of all gateway requests 
// requests will be of type: 'multipart/form-data'
// use this template to construct service request handlers 
// keys in quotes are required and will not have variable names
// keys in <brackets> will be user defined and variable
// if your service handles file objects, they will be attached
// to the 'file' request key in the form data. 

// most service requests will be deposit-scoped and will
// include at least the deposit_id in the 'data' object.
// top level-scoped service requests, such as a GET/list_all
// or POST/create_collection request will not include a deposit_id
// but may instead provide top level-scoped values in the 
// 'data' object. 

// the 'config' object is akin to HTTP headers. 
// keys in the 'config' object instruct the service how to 
// behave, provide flags for business logic, or pass state 
// from the gateway database. 
// the 'data' object is the payload of the request, which 
// is to say its content. 'data' key/values should not be
// used to control the service.
