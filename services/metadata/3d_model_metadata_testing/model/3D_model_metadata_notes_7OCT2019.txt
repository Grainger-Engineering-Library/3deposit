+ Edward's fields (check REPO under docs) - animated or not

+ File size, type, description, whether a file can be converted or not (e.g., OBJ -> GLTF is possible; True or False)

+ if OBJ file, might have multiple folders for "materials" or "mesh" ... so get Tree structure and info on all sub files of original 3d model type

+ Or could just use API to sketchfab when upload to Sketchfab, since we get a download link when it finishes
